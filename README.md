# php-graph
Graph (datastructure) library in PHP
Contains generic datastructures as well as implementations of a few common algorithms


This is my solution to the practice in SS2015 MMI lecture by Prof. Hoever at FH Aachen

  * Weighted Graphs as Edgelist
  * G_x_y, where x is number of nodes in multiples of 1,000 and y is the number of edges in multiples of 1,000
  * Line 1: Nodecount, following lines: Edges (i->j) and weight with Numbering scheme 0..Nodecount-1
* K_10.txt (38.41), K_10e.txt (27.26), K_12.txt (45.19), K_12e.txt (36.13), K_15.txt, K_15e.txt, K_20.txt, K_30.txt, K_50.txt, K_70.txt, K_100.txt
  * Complete weighted Graphs as Edgelist
  * K_z, where z is the nodecount, in K_ze the 3rd column is the distance from points in the plane
  * Line 1: Nodecount, following lines: Edges (i->j) and weight with Numbering scheme 0..Nodecount-1
  * Numbers in brackets are the optimal round trips
* Wege1.txt, Wege2.txt, Wege3.txt
  * same format as K_z
  * Shortest directed paths:
    * Wege1, 2->0: 6
    * Wege2, 2->0: 2
    * Wege3, 2->0: NEGATIVE CYCLE!
    * G_1_2, 0->1: 5.54417 (directed) vs. 2.36796 (undirected)
* Fluss.txt
  * Edgelist with capacities
  * Line 1: Nodecount, following lines: Edges (i->j) and capacity with Numbering scheme 0..Nodecount-1
  * Maximum Flows:
    * Fluss, 0->7: 4
    * G_1_2, use 3rd column as capacity, 0->7: 0.735802

  * Balances and Edgelist with cost and flow
  * Line 1: Nodecount n, following n lines: balances, following lines: Edges (i->j) and capacity and flow with Numbering scheme 0..Nodecount-1
  * Numbers in brackets are the costs of the cost minimal flow
* Matching_100_100.txt, Matching2_100_100.txt
